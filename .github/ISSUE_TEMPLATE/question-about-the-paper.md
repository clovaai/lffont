<!-- Note that the quality of the generated images are usually not a bug, but limitation of our work. Also, if you want to use this work as your own font generator, please consider to use other repositories. This work is an academic work, not considering all the factors in real-world. We will close an issue that just complains about the generated quality. -->

<!-- Our work is for "few-shot font generation". It means that we train a model with a number of font libraries and then generate a new font with very small number of references (e.g., 8). Therefore, if your case is not the same this case, we will close the issue. You may have tried to work with your custom training fonts. Please check the other issues before upload the issue -->

<!-- Our codebase is based on "compositionally" of languages. For Chinese, we use https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Chinese_characters_decomposition for the decomposition. If your character is not here, then our decomposition module will not work correctly. It is not a bug, therefore please make your own decomposition mappings. -->
